What is the maximum $u$ such that A and B don\u0026rsquo;t collide?\nSolution # Let $u_{max}$ be the maximum initial velocity of B such that A and B don\u0026rsquo;t collide. Let $s_A = d + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$ and $s_B = ut - \\frac{1}{2}at^2$. Then $u = u_{max}$ if $s_A = s_B$, i.e., when A stops, A and B barely touches. Then $d + \\frac{1}{2}at^2 = u_{max}t - \\frac{1}{2}at^2$. We write the equation making $t$ the subject. Then $at^2 - u_{max}t + d = 0$. A and B barely touches if the determinant $u_{max}^2 - 4ad = 0$. Therefore, $u_{max} = 2\\sqrt{ad}$.\nExample 2 - Kinematics # Two cars, A and B, start at the same position with the same speed $u$.

Let $2x_a$ be distance travelled with acceleration, where $2ax_a = u^2$. Then $s - 2x_a = u(t - 2t_a)$. We try to write it in $t_a$. Then, $s - at_a^2 = att_a - 2at_a^2$.

The speed of the swimmer in still water is $u$ and that of the water is $v$, where $v \u0026gt; u$. If the swimmer wants to cross the swift river with a minimum time, find the minimum time and position that he reaches in the opposite bank. Also, what is the direction along which the swimmer should proceed such that the downstream distance he has traveled when he reaches the opposite bank is the smallest possible? What is the corresponding time required.\nSolution # The swimmer swims in the direction of $j$ to achieve a minimum time $t_{min}$. Then $d = ut_{min}$ and $t_{min} = \\frac{d}{u}$. Then the x-component of the velocity of the swimmer is $v$. Let $s$ be the displacement of the swimmer. Then $s = vt_{min} = \\frac{dv}{u}$.\nLet $v_s$ be the velocity of the swimmer in the river. We choose $v_s = u + v$ such that $v_s$ is tangent to the circle produced with radius $u$ and center at $(v, 0^\\circ)$. Let $\\theta$ be the angle between $v$ and $v_s$ such that it points to the direction along which the swimmer should proceed such that the downstream distance is minimum. Then $\\theta = \\arcsin \\frac{u}{v}$. Let $s_{min}$ be the minimum downstream distance. Then $s_{min} = d\\cot \\theta$, where $\\cot \\theta = \\frac{v_s}{u} = \\frac{\\sqrt{v^2 - u^2}}{u}$. Therefore, $s_{min} = \\frac{d\\sqrt{v^2 - u^2}}{u}$.\nLet $v_y$ be the y-component of the velocity of the swimmer. Then $v_y = u\\cos \\theta = \\frac{u\\sqrt{v^2 - u^2}}{v}$. Since $d = v_yt$, then $t = \\frac{vd}{u\\sqrt{v^2 - u^2}}$.\nExample 8 - Linear Relative Motion # A bus is moving with a speed of 10 $m\\ s^{-1}$ on a straight road. A scooterist wishes to overtake the bus in 100 $s$. If the bus is at a distance of 1 $km$ from the scooterist, with what speed should the scooterist chase the bus?\nSolution # Let $v$ be the speed of the scooterist as required. Take the reference frame of the bus. Then $1000 = (v - 10) \\times 100$. Therefore $v = 20\\ m\\ s^{-1}$.\nExample 9 - Linear Relative Motion # The distance between two spots A and B on the same bank of the river is 75 $km$. Speed of the boat in still water is twice as much as that of the speed of the water current of the river. The boat travels in the river from A to B and returns to the original spot in 16 hours. What is the speed of the boat in still water.\nSolution # Let $u$ be the speed of the water current such that the speed of the boat in still water is $2u$. Then $\\frac{75}{2u + u} + \\frac{75}{2u - u} = 16$ and $u = 6.25\\ km\\ h^{-1}$. Therefore the speed of the boat is $12.5\\ km\\ h^{-1}$.\nExample 10 - Relative Velocity solved with Sine Law # An aircraft, whose speed in still air is 300 $km\\ h^{-1}$, flies in a straight line from R to S. The bearing of $S$ from $R$ is 195$^\\circ$. There is wind blowing from the east. The pilot needs to set a course due south to go to S. Suppose the wind remains unchanged. Find the direction of course the pilot needs to set to go back from S to R.\nSolution # Let $v_w$ be the velocity of the wind. Then $v_w = 300\\tan 15^\\circ = 80.4 km\\ h^{-1}$. Let $u$ be the velocity of the aircraft in still air and $v_{SR} = u + v_w$ be that from S to R. Let $\\theta$ be the angle between $u$ and $v_{SR}$. Then by sine rule, $\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{300\\tan 15^\\circ} = \\frac{\\sin 105^\\circ}{300}$.

An enermy aeroplane B is at the same height and flying due east at 400 $km/h$. Find the velocity of aeroplane B relative to A. Also at a certain moment, B is directly ahead of A. In which direction should A aim its machine gun? Its bullet travels at 300 $m/s$ as seen by pilot of A. Ignore air resistance.\nSolution # Let $v_a$ and $v_b$ be the velocity of A and B respectively. Then $v_{ba} = v_b - v_a$ is the velocity of B relative to A. Therefore $v_{ba} = \\sqrt{400^2 + 500^2} = 640\\ km\\ h^{-1}$.\nTake the reference frame of aeroplane A. Let $\\theta$ be the angle between $v_{ba}$ and $v_b$. Then $\\theta = \\arctan \\frac{500}{400} = 51.3^\\circ$. Then aeroplane B is flying at the direction of $51.3^\\circ SE$. Let $v_m$ be the velocity of the bullet fired from the machine gun. Then $v_m = 1080\\ km\\ h^{-1}$. Choose $v_m$ such that it forms a triangle with $v_{ba}$ and $AB$. Let $\\psi$ be the angle between $AB$ and $v_m$. Then by sine rule, $\\frac{\\sin \\psi}{640} = \\frac{\\sin 38.7}{1080}$. Therefore $\\psi = 21.7^\\circ$ and the pilot of A should aim its machine gun in the direction $N21.7^\\circ E$.\nExample 12 - Relative Velocity solved with Geometry # A ship A is steering at a course $N60^\\circ W$ at 30 $km/ h^{-1}$. At a certain instant, a second ship B is 20 $km$ due west of ship A and is moving with a constant speed of $15\\sqrt{2}$km h^{-1}$. Find the earliest possible time that ship B can reach the ship A.\nSolution # Take the reference frame of ship A. Let $v_a$ and $v_b$ be the velocity of ship A and B. Choose $v_b$ such that $v_{ba} = v_b - v_a$ the velocity of ship B with respect to A is due east. Let $\\theta$ be the angle between $AB$ and $-v_a$. Then $\\theta = 30^\\circ$. Let $\\psi$ be the angle opposite to $v_{a}$. Then by sine rule, $\\frac{\\sin \\psi}{30} = \\frac{\\sin 30^\\circ}{15\\sqrt{2}}$. Then $\\psi = 45^\\circ$. Then $v_{ba} = 30 \\cos 30^\\circ + 15\\sqrt{2} \\cos 45^\\circ = 41.0\\ km\\ h^{-1}$. Let $t_{min}$ be the minimum time. Therefore $20 = 41.0t$ and $t = 0.488 hr$.\nExample 13 - Relative Velocity solved with Sine and Cosine Rule # Ship A is 10 $km$ due west of ship B. Ship A is heading directly north at a speed of 30 $km/h$ while ship B is heading in a direction $60^\\circ$ west of north at a speed of 20 $km/h$. What is the relative velocity of ship B with respect to A? What will the shortest possible distance between ship A and B?\nSolution # Take reference frame of ship A. Let $v_a$ and $v_b$ be the velocity of ship A and B respectively such that $v_{ba} = v_b - v_a$ is the velocity of A with respect to B. Then by consine rule $v_{ba} = \\sqrt{20^2 + 30^2 - 2(20)(30)\\cos 60^\\circ} = 26.5\\ km\\ h^{-1}$. Let $\\theta$ be the angle opposite of $v_{b}$.

This differs significantly from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable Type\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Convert Line Breaks\u0026rdquo; option) which translate every line break character in a paragraph into a \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; tag.\nWhen you do want to insert a \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; break tag using Markdown, you end a line with two or more spaces, then type return.\nHeaders # Markdown supports two styles of headers, [Setext] [1] and [atx] [2].\nOptionally, you may \u0026ldquo;close\u0026rdquo; atx-style headers. This is purely cosmetic \u0026ndash; you can use this if you think it looks better. The closing hashes don\u0026rsquo;t even need to match the number of hashes used to open the header. (The number of opening hashes determines the header level.)\nBlockquotes # Markdown uses email-style \u0026gt; characters for blockquoting. If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with quoting passages of text in an email message, then you know how to create a blockquote in Markdown. It looks best if you hard wrap the text and put a \u0026gt; before every line:\nThis is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\nDonec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\nMarkdown allows you to be lazy and only put the \u0026gt; before the first line of a hard-wrapped paragraph:\nThis is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\nDonec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\nBlockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by adding additional levels of \u0026gt;:\nThis is the first level of quoting.\nThis is nested blockquote.\nBack to the first level.\nBlockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and code blocks:\nThis is a header. # This is the first list item. This is the second list item. Here\u0026rsquo;s some example code:\nreturn shell_exec(\u0026quot;echo $input | $markdown_script\u0026quot;); Any decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy. For example, with BBEdit, you can make a selection and choose Increase Quote Level from the Text menu.\nLists # Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.\nUnordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens \u0026ndash; interchangably \u0026ndash; as list markers:\nRed Green Blue is equivalent to:\nRed Green Blue and:\nRed Green Blue Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:\nBird McHale Parish It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the actual numbers you use to mark the list have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces. The HTML Markdown produces from the above list is:\nIf you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this:\nBird McHale Parish or even:\nBird McHale Parish you\u0026rsquo;d get the exact same HTML output. The point is, if you want to, you can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markdown lists, so that the numbers in your source match the numbers in your published HTML. But if you want to be lazy, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to.\nTo make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing. But if you want to be lazy, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing. List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one tab:\nThis is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.\nVestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.\nSuspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\nIt looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent paragraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow you to be lazy:\nThis is a list item with two paragraphs.\nThis is the second paragraph in the list item. You\u0026rsquo;re only required to indent the first line. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\nAnother item in the same list.\nTo put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote\u0026rsquo;s \u0026gt; delimiters need to be indented:\nA list item with a blockquote:\nThis is a blockquote inside a list item.\nTo put a code block within a list item, the code block needs to be indented twice \u0026ndash; 8 spaces or two tabs:\nA list item with a code block:\n\u0026lt;code goes here\u0026gt; Code Blocks # Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both \u0026lt;pre\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt; tags.\nTo produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.\nThis is a normal paragraph:\nThis is a code block. Here is an example of AppleScript:\ntell application \u0026quot;Foo\u0026quot; beep end tell A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented (or the end of the article).\nWithin a code block, ampersands (\u0026amp;) and angle brackets (\u0026lt; and \u0026gt;) are automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it very easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown \u0026ndash; just paste it and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the ampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;footer\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g., asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means it\u0026rsquo;s also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown\u0026rsquo;s own syntax.\ntell application \u0026#34;Foo\u0026#34; beep end tell Span Elements # Links # Markdown supports two style of links: inline and reference.\nIn both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].\nTo create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text\u0026rsquo;s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an optional title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:\nThis is an example inline link.\nThis link has no title attribute.\nEmphasis # Markdown treats asterisks (*) and underscores (_) as indicators of emphasis. Text wrapped with one * or _ will be wrapped with an HTML \u0026lt;em\u0026gt; tag; double *\u0026rsquo;s or _\u0026rsquo;s will be wrapped with an HTML \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt; tag. E.g., this input:\nsingle asterisks\nsingle underscores\ndouble asterisks\ndouble underscores\nCode # To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph. For example:\nUse the printf() function.\n","date":"2022/10/25","permalink":"/posts/miscellaneous/markdown_test/","section":"Posts","summary":"Original from mxstbr/markdown-test-file Markdown: Syntax # Overview Philosophy Inline HTML Automatic Escaping for Special Characters Block Elements Paragraphs and Line Breaks Headers Blockquotes Lists Code Blocks Horizontal Rules Span Elements Links Emphasis Code Images Miscellaneous Backslash Escapes Automatic Links Note: This document is itself written using Markdown; you can see the source for it by adding \u0026lsquo;.","title":"Markdown Test File"},{"content":"","date":"0001/01/01","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"0001/01/01","permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"}]
